# desk-ops

A web application that simulates what someone may see working at a help desk. I do not have help desk experience currently so I will be making assumptions. I am making this project to get some experience in both web development and to see what it might be like to work as a help desk technician.

## Pseudo code

### Function to answer the phone

LET calls = an array of calls asking for help\

getPhoneCall(call) {\
    FOR EACH call
        RETURN call details in a pop up
    ENDFOR
}
